# Text Sentiment Analyzer with LSTM and CNN

## Description
This project develops a Text Sentiment Analyzer using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately determine the sentiment of text data. 

Built with TensorFlow and the IMDB dataset, it showcases the power of deep learning in understanding and classifying natural language.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sorena-Dev/Text-Sentiment-Analyzer-with-LSTM-and-CNN.git
cd Text-Sentiment-Analyzer-with-LSTM-and-CNN
pip install numpy tensorflow
```

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with pip.

## Usage

To run the sentiment analyzer, execute the `Text Sentiment Analyzer with LSTM and CNN.py` script in your environment:

```bash
python "Text Sentiment Analyzer with LSTM and CNN.py"
```

This script will train the model using the IMDB dataset and then evaluate its performance. The output includes the test loss and accuracy, providing insight into the model's effectiveness in sentiment analysis.

### In Real-World Scenarios

This model can be applied in various real-world scenarios, including:

- Analyzing customer reviews and feedback across different platforms to gauge overall sentiment.
- Monitoring social media to understand public opinion on specific topics, brands, or products.
- Enhancing customer service by automatically categorizing user sentiments in communications.

## Features

- Utilizes the IMDB dataset for training and testing.
- Employs a sophisticated neural network architecture combining LSTM and CNN layers for deep text analysis.
- Achieves high accuracy in classifying text sentiments into positive or negative categories.
- Includes detailed logging of model performance metrics for evaluation.

## Real-World Application Scenarios

1. **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Automatically sort customer reviews into positive or negative sentiments, helping businesses improve their products and services.
2. **Social Media Monitoring:** Track and analyze sentiments on social media posts or comments related to specific topics, campaigns, or events.
3. **Content Recommendation:** Improve content recommendation engines by incorporating sentiment analysis to understand user preferences better.
